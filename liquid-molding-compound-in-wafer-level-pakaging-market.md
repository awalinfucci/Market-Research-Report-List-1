<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Molding Compound in Wafer Level Pakaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FI WLP</li><li>FO WLP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid Molding Compound (LMC) is vital in wafer level packaging (WLP), providing a protective, lightweight encapsulation for semiconductor devices. The market is primarily divided into two types: Fan-In Wafer Level Packaging (FI WLP) and Fan-Out Wafer Level Packaging (FO WLP). FI WLP involves encapsulating chips with wiring on the same side, promoting compactness. In contrast, FO WLP spreads the connections on the outer area of the die, facilitating larger I/O counts and better thermal performance, making both approaches essential for advanced electronic applications.</p></p>
