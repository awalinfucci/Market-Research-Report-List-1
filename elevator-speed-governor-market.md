<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Elevator Speed Governor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Type</li><li>Resonance Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The elevator speed governor market comprises two main types: centrifugal and resonance governors. Centrifugal governors operate using rotational motion to regulate speed, preventing overspeed by mechanically engaging brakes when necessary. They are widely used for their reliability and simplicity. In contrast, resonance governors utilize the principle of oscillation to detect speed variations, offering a more sensitive and accurate response to changes in elevator speed. Each type serves specific applications, with centrifugal governors favored for traditional elevators and resonance governors for advanced systems.</p></p>
