<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flange Bolts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Partial Thread</li><li>Full Thread</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flange bolts market can be categorized into partial thread and full thread types. Partial thread flange bolts feature a threaded portion that extends only partway along the bolt shank, offering greater grip and load distribution over the flange surface. In contrast, full thread flange bolts are entirely threaded, providing uniform tension and allowing for deeper engagement in the connected materials. Each type serves distinct applications, with partial threads often preferred for structural integrity and full threads used for versatility in fastening.</p></p>
