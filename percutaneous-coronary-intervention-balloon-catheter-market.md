<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Balloon Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Compliant</li><li>Non Compliant</li><li>Compliant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) balloon catheter market is categorized into three types: semi-compliant, non-compliant, and compliant balloons. Semi-compliant balloons expand to a predetermined size and are ideal for moderate lesions. Non-compliant balloons maintain their shape and can apply higher pressures, suitable for more challenging blockages. Compliant balloons adapt their size based on vessel elasticity, making them effective for gentle dilation. Each type serves specific clinical needs, enhancing treatment outcomes in coronary interventions.</p></p>
