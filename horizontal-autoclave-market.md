<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Horizontal Autoclave Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity</li><li>SFPP</li><li>Pre-Vac</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The horizontal autoclave market features three primary types: Gravity, Steam-Filled Prevacuum (SFPP), and Pre-Vacuum autoclaves. Gravity autoclaves rely on gravity to circulate steam for sterilization, making them suitable for liquids and other items that do not require rapid processing. SFPP autoclaves use steam to fill the chamber and eliminate air, enhancing penetration for more effective sterilization. Pre-Vacuum autoclaves utilize a vacuum to remove air before steam introduction, ensuring thorough sterilization of complex instruments and porous materials.</p></p>
