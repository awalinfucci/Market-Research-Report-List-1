<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio Pharma Logistics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Generic Drugs</li><li>Branded Drugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biopharma logistics market is divided into two main types: generic drugs and branded drugs. Generic drugs are cost-effective alternatives to branded counterparts and are produced once patents expire, requiring efficient logistics for distribution. In contrast, branded drugs are innovative products marketed under a proprietary name, often involving complex storage and transportation needs due to their temperature sensitivity and regulatory requirements. Proper logistics management is critical for both types to ensure product integrity and timely delivery to healthcare providers.</p></p>
