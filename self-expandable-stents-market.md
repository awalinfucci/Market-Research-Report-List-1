<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self expandable Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Memory Alloy</li><li>Non Memory Alloy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The self-expandable stent market comprises two main types: memory alloy and non-memory alloy stents. Memory alloy stents, often made from materials like nickel-titanium, possess the ability to expand to their intended shape upon body temperature activation, providing improved flexibility and adaptability within vascular structures. Non-memory alloy stents, typically made from stainless steel or other rigid materials, rely on mechanical force for deployment. Both types serve to maintain vessel patency, but their applications and performance characteristics vary based on material properties.</p></p>
